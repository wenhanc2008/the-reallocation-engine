# Status — The Reallocation Engine

_Read this first for current state._ `DOMAIN.md` = what the repo **is**; `logs/RUN_LOG.md` = the full **history**; this file = **where we are now and what's next**.

## Where things stand
- **Manuscript:** 21 chapter files drafted (`chapters/00`–`99`), introduction through back matter.
- **Pipeline (runnable today):** SEC Form D, BLS/O*NET extracts, ATS scan/liveness, resumes → PDF, the Ch.11 Bayesian role scorer (`npm run score`), plus `npm run doctor` and `npm run verify`.
- **Context architecture:** root `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` compile from `instructions/` modules; `.claude/` hooks (archive-guard + conformance) and a CI drift-guard are in place.
- **Data:** full SEC/BLS datasets are gitignored; small samples are shipped — see `DATA.md`.
- **Recipes:** all 42 carry lifecycle frontmatter; all are still `status: DRAFT`.

## The one thing that matters next
**The honest run (gap #4).** No recipe has completed a logged, gated end-to-end run yet. Promoting any recipe past `DRAFT` requires it, and the schema/scorer-wiring work below exists to enable it.

## Open questions / decisions pending
- **Run-envelope schema** is still `[TODO: DEFINE]` in `recipes/pipeline.md` — blocks wiring the Ch.7–10 evidence feeds into the scorer.
- **Scorer `[VERIFY]` defaults:** the `role_quality` weight and the Consider-band floor reproduce the book but are not pinned by Ch.11 — confirm against `docs/search-profile-design.md` before using for real decisions.
- **Terminology (gap #7):** the book says "skill," the repo says "recipe" — unreconciled.

## Recently done (2026-06-14)
- Decluttered the root; dual-licensed (MIT code / CC BY 4.0 book); set up large-file handling (samples + gitignore + a pre-commit size guard, documented in `DATA.md`); added the CLI-agnostic AI tooling guide and a repo audit under `docs/`.

_Update this file at the end of each working session: state, decisions, next actions. Keep it short — it's the current-state file, not a log._
