# Chapter 1 — The Fluency Trap
*What the screen never asks you — and why fluency and correctness stopped being the same thing.*

It is a Tuesday in March, and you are twelve minutes into a take-home assignment for a job you need more than the people interviewing you will ever know. The prompt asks you to clean a dataset and justify your choices. You paste it into the model. Three seconds pass. The answer arrives — complete, formatted, confident. There is a function. There are comments. There is even a short paragraph explaining the reasoning, written in the calm cadence of someone who has done this a hundred times.

You read it. It looks right. It looks, in fact, exactly like what a competent analyst would produce. You run it. It runs. The chart has labels. The nulls are handled. Nothing on the screen is asking you for anything.

So you submit it.

Here is what you cannot see in that moment: whether the model dropped a category of rows that mattered, whether the imputation it chose quietly biased the result toward the answer the hiring manager wants, whether the "reasonable" choice it made is the one a domain expert would have flagged in a sentence. You cannot see it because seeing it is a separate skill from producing it — and producing it is the part you just handed away.

This is the trap. Not failure. Fluency. The first sign of trouble is almost never a crash or an error message or a blank screen. It is a clean output that looks like the work of an expert, produced by a system that has no idea whether it is right, handed to a person who has not yet built the judgment to check.

I want to take that apart, because almost everything that matters about working in the AI era — and almost everything that matters for you specifically, if you are an international student with a visa clock running — lives inside it.

## Two Words Doing Different Jobs

We need to separate two things that the word "work" has been quietly gluing together.

The first is **execution**: producing the artifact. Writing the function, drafting the email, building the slide, generating the SQL, cleaning the rows. Execution is the visible output — the thing that appears on the screen and can be graded, shipped, or submitted.

The second is **judgment**: the decision about whether that artifact should exist, whether it is right, whether it fits the situation in front of you, what it leaves out, and what follows from using it. Judgment is the part that does not appear on the screen. It is the analyst noticing that the "cleaned" dataset threw away every applicant who left one field blank — and that those applicants were disproportionately the ones the model was supposed to find.

For most of the history of work, these two arrived welded together. You could not produce the artifact without exercising at least some judgment along the way, because producing it was slow and manual and full of small decisions. The grind *was* the training. Every junior analyst who hand-cleaned a thousand datasets was, without being told, building the pattern-recognition that would later let them glance at a result and feel that something was off.

AI breaks the weld. It makes execution nearly free and nearly instant, and it leaves judgment exactly as expensive as it ever was. That is the whole event. Not "AI is smart" or "AI is dumb." AI is *fluent* — it produces the surface of competence at a speed and polish no human can match — and fluency and correctness are not the same thing.

Watch how this shows up in how work is actually graded. In courses that permit AI use — because in the real world everyone has the same tools — roughly three-quarters of a typical grade measures procedural competence: did you follow the constraints, meet the technical requirements, use the tools correctly, produce complete and coherent work on time? Everyone with a model can now do that. The remaining fifth or so measures judgment: did you understand the *actual* problem rather than the stated one, what did you decide under ambiguity, would this survive contact with a real stakeholder?[^grading] The first portion has collapsed in value because it has collapsed in scarcity. The second has not, because it cannot be generated.

So the question "can you do the work?" has split into two questions that now have wildly different answers. Can you produce the artifact? Yes — so can everyone, instantly. Can you tell whether the artifact is any good? That is the only question left with a scarce answer. And it is the one the screen never asks you.

![Two aligned stacked bars. The first splits total value into a large procedural-competence base and a smaller judgment cap. The second recuts the same split by supplier — the procedural base is machine-suppliable, the small judgment cap is human-exclusive.](../images/01-the-fluency-trap-fig-01.png)
*Figure 1.1 — The value split: who can supply the work*

<!-- → [CHART: two-bar column chart showing the value split — "Procedural competence" (~75-80%) vs "Judgment" (~20-25%) as share of grade/market value; a second panel shows the same split for "Who can supply it" — AI can supply the first bar almost entirely, humans exclusively supply the second; caption should read: "The question 'can you do the work?' has split. One half is now free. The other has not moved."] -->

## Why the Doing Was the Training

Now the mechanism — the part I had to think through several times before it sat still.

If judgment is so valuable, why not just skip the grind and learn judgment directly? Read the textbook, study the patterns, let the machine handle the grunt work, and arrive at the senior-level skill without the thousand tedious repetitions?

Because that is not how the skill forms. And we now have a clean experiment showing it.

In January 2026, Anthropic published a randomized controlled trial — the kind of study where you split people into two groups, change exactly one thing, and watch what happens.[^anthropic] They took fifty-two junior software engineers and had them learn a Python library called Trio that none of them knew. One group could use an AI assistant. The other had to write the code by hand. Same problem, same time, one difference: who did the executing.

Then — and this is the move that makes it an experiment about judgment rather than productivity — they gave everyone the same quiz afterward. Fourteen questions on reading, debugging, and understanding the library. A test not of *can you produce code* but of *do you understand what the code does*.

The hand-coding group averaged 67 percent. The AI-assisted group averaged 50 percent. Seventeen points — close to two letter grades — opened up between two sets of people who had just spent the same amount of time on the same problem.[^anthropic] The only thing that differed was whether a machine did the executing.

And here is the detail that turns a finding into a warning. Inside the AI group, behavior split the outcome cleanly. The engineers who used the model to *interrogate* — asking it conceptual questions, challenging its answers, forcing themselves to understand what it produced — scored 65 percent or higher. The engineers who used it to *delegate* — describe the problem, accept the output, move on — scored below 40.[^anthropic] Same tool. Same task. Opposite result. The variable was not the AI. It was whether the human kept doing the judgment work while the machine did the typing.

![Three vertical bars. Hand-coding and AI-plus-interrogation sit at nearly the same height; AI-plus-delegation drops off sharply, with a faint reference line linking the two high bars.](../images/01-the-fluency-trap-fig-02.png)
*Figure 1.2 — The Anthropic RCT: comprehension by how the tool was used*

<!-- → [INFOGRAPHIC: three-column comparison — "Hand-coding" (67% comprehension quiz average), "AI + interrogation" (≥65%), "AI + delegation" (<40%); visual treatment should emphasize that the middle and left columns converge while the right column falls off sharply; caption: "The tool is identical in the middle and right columns. The variable is what the human does while it runs."] -->

That is the mechanism, and it has a name worth carrying: **comprehension debt**. When you let the machine execute and you skip the understanding, you do not avoid the cost of learning. You defer it. You take out a loan against a moment in the future when the system breaks in a way that requires you to understand it — and comprehension debt, like every debt, comes due at the worst possible time, with interest.

The senior engineer and the junior engineer can run the exact same prompt and get opposite trajectories from it. Give a model to someone who already has judgment, and it multiplies them — they read the output, hear the wrong note before the tests catch it, steer and correct. Researchers call that the **AI boost**. Give the same model to someone who has not yet built that judgment, and it produces plausible output they cannot evaluate, the work gets done, and the learning does not happen. That is **AI drag**.[^drag] The tool is identical. The difference is entirely in what the human brings to it — and what they keep doing while it runs.

Sit with the cruelty of that for a second, because it is the center of this book. The boost goes to people who already have judgment. The drag falls on the people still trying to build it. AI does not lift everyone equally. It widens the gap between those who can already tell good from plausible and those who cannot yet — and it does so precisely at the rung where that telling was supposed to be learned.

## The Rung That Got Removed

Step back from the one student at the desk and look at the whole structure.

The traditional path to judgment ran through unglamorous work. You joined as a junior, you did the boilerplate, the cleanup, the first drafts nobody senior wanted to write — and in doing it, over a couple of years, you built the eye. The grunt work was the apprenticeship. It was never efficient. It was how the judgment got made.

That rung is the exact rung AI executes best. Boilerplate code, first-draft memos, routine cleanup, standard analysis — the fluent, common, likely output is precisely what the machine produces at no cost. So the rational short-term move for a company is to stop hiring for it. Why pay a junior to do slowly and imperfectly what the model does instantly?

You can watch the contradiction this creates play out in public. In February 2026, IBM's chief human resources officer, Nickle LaMoreaux, stood up at a summit in New York and announced that IBM would *triple* its entry-level hiring in the United States — including software developers, the very roles "we're being told AI can do."[^ibm] Her argument was not sentimental. It was structural: a company that skips entry-level hiring to save money now will, in three to five years, have no one with the judgment to run the powerful tools it bought, and will have to poach mid-level people from competitors at a premium. The pipeline that produces senior judgment runs through junior work. Cut the bottom rung and you do not get cheaper seniors. You get no seniors.

IBM rewrote the junior role rather than deleting it — less routine coding, more AI oversight, error correction, customer contact, what they called "systems judgment."[^ibm] Read that closely. They did not eliminate the entry-level job. They redefined it as *the judgment part of the job, with the execution stripped out*. The boilerplate went to the machine. What is left for the human, even on day one, is the part the machine cannot do.

This is the inversion that has happened to skilled work across the board. A software engineer used to spend perhaps ninety percent of the day as the musician — fingers on keys, translating intent into syntax, debugging semicolons — and maybe ten percent on judgment, squeezed into the margins. That ratio has flipped. The execution is cheap; the work that is left, and the work that is paid for, is the judgment: what should this system do, does it introduce a risk, is it solving a problem worth solving.[^inversion]

And the market is pricing it exactly that way. As of 2025, AI had moved from a curiosity to a board-level liability: the share of S&P 500 companies naming AI as a *material risk* in their annual filings jumped from 12 percent in 2023 to 72 percent in 2025.[^spx] A material risk is not hype — it is a legal disclosure that this could hurt the company badly enough that shareholders must be warned. Seven hundred of America's largest firms, in the dry language of securities law, are telling their investors that getting the judgment wrong about these fluent machines is a danger to the enterprise. The thing they are afraid of is not that the AI cannot execute. It is that someone will trust a fluent output that was wrong.

![A single rising line across three time points — about 12 percent in 2023, 72 percent in 2025, and 83 percent in the late-2025 update — with the steep first segment emphasized as the moment hype becomes liability.](../images/01-the-fluency-trap-fig-03.png)

## Why This Lands Hardest on You

Now bring the two pictures together — the student at the desk and the structure around them — because at their intersection sits a specific person this book is written for.

If you are an international student in the United States on F-1 status, working under Optional Practical Training, you are standing exactly where the boost and the drag pull hardest in opposite directions, and you are doing it against a clock written into federal law.

Here is the clock. On post-completion OPT, you may accrue no more than ninety cumulative days of unemployment across your entire authorization period. Not business days — calendar days. Weekends count. Holidays count. The counter starts the day your work authorization begins and does not stop. Exceed it, and the Department of Homeland Security terminates your immigration record. There is no grace period. You must leave the country.[^opt] This is why the system at the heart of this book budgets to *eighty* days, not ninety — you want a margin between you and a cliff that does not forgive.

![A single horizontal authorization bar with a filled cumulative-unemployment segment, a dashed marker at 80 days labeled the book's working limit, and a solid hard stop at 90 days where the immigration record is terminated with no grace period.](../images/01-the-fluency-trap-fig-04.png)
*Figure 1.4 — The 90-day OPT unemployment clock*

<!-- → [INFOGRAPHIC: timeline diagram showing the 90-day unemployment clock — a horizontal bar representing the OPT authorization period, with a red segment marking cumulative unemployment days, a dashed line at 80 days labeled "this book's working limit," and a hard stop at 90 labeled "DHS terminates record / no grace period"; annotate that weekends and holidays count; caption: "The clock does not distinguish between a Tuesday and a Sunday. It runs."] -->

Now lay the structure on top of that clock. The entry-level rung — the one that used to absorb new graduates and teach them judgment over a patient couple of years — is the rung being automated and, in most companies that are not IBM, quietly removed. The market is paying for judgment you have not yet been given the chance to build. And the most natural response to a ninety-day clock and a wall of rejections is to apply faster — to let the machine generate the cover letters, autofill the applications, produce the take-home in three fluent seconds and submit it. To delegate. To run up comprehension debt at the precise moment you can least afford to have it come due in an interview.

The fluency trap, for you, is not abstract. It is the difference between using these tools as a boost — interrogating, checking, building the judgment that makes you the rare candidate who can tell good from plausible — and using them as a drag, producing fluent applications that look like everyone else's fluent applications, learning nothing, and watching the days tick down.

This is the trade-off named plainly. AI optimizes for the fluent, the common, the likely. That is what it is *for*, and it is genuinely miraculous at it. What it cannot do is supply the salient, the situated, the correct-in-this-particular-case — the judgment about whether the likely answer is the right answer here, for this dataset, this employer, this person whose visa depends on it. Lean on the fluency and skip the judgment, and the tool works beautifully right up until the moment it matters, which is the one moment it cannot help you.

## What the Screen Never Asks

Return to the Tuesday afternoon, the take-home, the answer that arrived in three clean seconds.

Nothing on that screen was wrong, exactly. The code ran. The chart had labels. The reasoning read like competence. The trap was never that the output would look like failure. The trap is that it looks like success — and that the success is the machine's, produced in a register of fluency that asks nothing of you and quietly skips the one contribution only you can make.

So the discipline this entire book is built on starts with a single reflex, and you can begin practicing it this afternoon. When the fluent artifact appears, do not first ask whether it is impressive. Ask what would have to be true for it to be trusted. Ask what the machine could not know — about this dataset, this employer, this situation it has never seen. Ask what you are now responsible for when this leaves the screen and reaches a human who will act on it.

That reflex is judgment. It is the part that does not get cheaper. On a ninety-day clock, with the bottom rung disappearing and the boost flowing to whoever already has the eye, it is also the only thing that reliably separates you from the flood of fluent, identical, unexamined output arriving in every inbox you are trying to reach.

The machine will do the typing. The judgment is yours, and it always was. The rest of this book is about how to build it on purpose — fast enough to beat the clock.

**What Would Change My Mind.** If a replication of the Anthropic trial — or several — found that AI-assisted learners caught up to or surpassed hand-coders on delayed comprehension once they had used the tools for longer, the "comprehension debt" mechanism would need serious revision: it would mean the debt is repaid by familiarity rather than compounding. The current evidence is one well-designed but small (n = 52) study; one study is a finding, not a law.

**Still Puzzling.** I do not fully understand where the line sits between *interrogating* a model and *delegating* to it in real practice. The trial shows the two produce opposite outcomes, but a working analyst does both within the same hour, often within the same prompt. I do not yet know how to teach someone to feel which skill they are in while they are in it — and that, not the statistics, may be the hardest thing this book has to do.

## Chapter 1 Exercises: The Fluency Trap

**Project:** Your Own Reallocation Engine

**This chapter adds:** the foundation of your engine — the judgment frame it runs on. Before you collect a single record, you set up the project, write the interrogation reflex into it as a standing rule, and open the "what the machine could not know" log that every later chapter will feed.

---

### Exercise 1 — When to Use AI

**The judgment:** In this chapter's work, AI assistance is appropriate for the following tasks:

- **Drafting the scaffolding of your project's founding documents.** — *Why AI works here:* a README, a folder layout, a checklist template are reformatting and boilerplate generation; you can read every line and judge whether it says what you mean.
- **Generating a first-pass list of interrogation questions to ask of any fluent output.** — *Why AI works here:* this is option generation — the model proposes candidate questions, and you, holding the chapter's execution/judgment distinction, keep the ones that actually probe correctness.
- **Explaining a concept you half-understand back to you in three different framings.** — *Why AI works here:* this is the *interrogation* mode the Anthropic trial rewarded; you are using the model to build judgment, not to skip it, and you verify by trying to re-explain it yourself.

**The tell:** You know you are using AI appropriately when you can evaluate the output — when you have independent criteria to judge whether it is correct, complete, and fit for purpose. In this chapter the criterion is: can you re-explain it without the model in front of you?

---

### Exercise 2 — When NOT to Use AI

**The judgment:** In this chapter's work, the following tasks require human judgment. Delegating them to AI is not appropriate — not because AI cannot produce output, but because AI output in these cases cannot be trusted without verification that requires the same expertise as doing the task yourself.

- **Deciding what your engine is actually for and what "a good outcome" means for you.** — *Why AI fails here:* this is a values-and-stakes judgment tied to your visa clock, your field, and your risk tolerance — facts the model does not have and would fabricate plausibly if asked.
- **Submitting any take-home or assessment the model produced that you cannot defend line by line.** — *Why AI fails here:* this is the chapter's central trap — fluent output you cannot evaluate is comprehension debt, and the interview is where it comes due, with interest.
- **Judging whether you are interrogating or delegating in a given session.** — *Why AI fails here:* the model cannot see your learning; only you can notice whether you understood the output or merely accepted it.

**The tell:** You know you have crossed the line when you are using AI output as your reason for a conclusion rather than as a tool for reaching one. If you could not explain the conclusion without the AI, the AI did the work that should have been yours.

**Series connection:** This exercise trains **Tier 4 (Metacognitive supervision)** — the capacity to monitor your own understanding and to distinguish a fluent surface from a grasped mechanism. The whole book's spine is this tier; Chapter 1 installs it before any tool is picked up.

---

### Exercise 3 — LLM Exercise

**What you're building this chapter:** the founding charter of your engine — a one-page "What the machine cannot know about my search" document plus a reusable interrogation checklist — the first entry in the account that becomes your final deliverable.

**Tool:** Claude (claude.ai chat). A Claude Project is worth starting now if you'll run the whole book here — put the charter in the project knowledge so every later chat inherits your stakes.

**The Prompt:**

```
I am building a personal job-search "reallocation engine" over the course of a
book, and this is the founding step. Help me draft two short documents. Ask me
nothing you can infer; where you need a fact about my situation that you do not
have, insert a clearly marked [FILL IN] placeholder rather than inventing it.

Document 1 — "What the machine cannot know about my search" (about half a page):
a plain-language list of the things an AI scorer or chatbot structurally cannot
know about my job search — for example, private information about specific
employers, my own deadline pressure, which mission I can speak about with
conviction, what a particular rejection actually meant. Frame each as a
one-line reminder I will re-read whenever I'm tempted to trust a fluent answer.

Document 2 — "Interrogation checklist" (6–10 questions): a reusable list of
questions I should ask of ANY fluent AI output before I act on it, grounded in
the distinction between producing an artifact and judging whether it is correct.
Include at least one question about what the output left out, one about what it
would take to verify it, and one about what I become responsible for once I pass
it to a human.

Output both as clean markdown I can save. Do not pad with motivation.
```

**What this produces:** two markdown documents — `what-the-machine-cannot-know.md` and `interrogation-checklist.md` — that seed your project and that you will literally reuse in every later validation exercise.

**How to adapt this prompt:**
- *For your own project:* fill the `[FILL IN]` placeholders with your real field, visa timeline, and target sector before saving. The charter is worthless generic and sharp when specific.
- *For ChatGPT / Gemini:* works as-is; both tend to add a pep-talk intro — append "no preamble, start with the first document's heading."
- *For a Claude Project:* paste the finished charter into the project's custom instructions so it constrains every future answer.

**Connection to previous chapters:** this is the first exercise — it establishes the judgment frame the rest build on.

**Preview of next chapter:** Chapter 2 turns this frame into a time budget — you'll build the 3-3-2 plan and the target list your engine actually runs against.

---

### Exercise 4 — CLI Exercise

**What you're building this chapter:** the skeleton of your project repository — the folders, a `JUDGMENT_LOG.md`, and a `CLAUDE.md` seeded with the interrogation rule so the rule binds every future agentic session.

**Tool:** Claude Code. Scaffolding a directory, creating several files, and seeding a persistent instruction file is a multi-file setup task that suits an agentic CLI over chat.

**Skill level:** Beginner — this is your first terminal exercise; it creates files and does not touch data.

**Setup:**

Before running this exercise, confirm:
- [ ] You have a folder where your engine will live, and Claude Code can open it.
- [ ] You saved the two documents from Exercise 3 (you'll move them into the repo).
- [ ] You have decided nothing destructive runs without your say-so (you'll state this in the task).

**The Task:**

```
Create the starting structure for a personal job-search project in this folder.
Do not delete or overwrite anything that already exists — if a file is present,
stop and show me before changing it.

1. Create these folders: data/, recipes/, reports/, notes/.
2. Create JUDGMENT_LOG.md with a short header and one empty dated template entry
   with fields: Date, What I asked AI to do, Interrogation/Delegation (which was
   it?), What the machine could not know, What I verified myself.
3. Create CLAUDE.md containing a single standing rule, stated plainly:
   "Before trusting any count, claim, or recommendation in this project, run the
   check that produces it and read the output. Never accept an invented number.
   Label anything that is AI judgment rather than a counted fact."
4. Move my two files (what-the-machine-cannot-know.md and
   interrogation-checklist.md) into notes/ if they are in this folder.
5. Print the resulting file tree and the contents of CLAUDE.md so I can confirm.

Stop after step 5.
```

**Expected output:** a project tree with four folders, a `JUDGMENT_LOG.md` template, a `CLAUDE.md` carrying the interrogation rule, and your two charter files filed under `notes/`.

**What to inspect in the output:** read `CLAUDE.md` back — is the rule stated as an instruction the agent will actually follow, or as vague aspiration? Confirm nothing pre-existing was overwritten.

**If it goes wrong:** the most common failure is the agent creating files at the wrong path (e.g. a nested duplicate folder). Recover by asking it to print the absolute path of each file it created and move any misplaced ones; do not let it "clean up" by deleting without showing you first.

**CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md note:** this exercise *is* the CLAUDE.md note — you are establishing the project's first standing rule. Every later chapter adds to this file; Chapter 3 will tighten this rule into the full verified-data contract.

---

### Exercise 5 — AI Validation Exercise

**What you're validating:** a fluent, confident take-home solution of exactly the kind the chapter opens with — code that runs clean and is quietly wrong.

**Validation type:** Code (with a reasoning-chain component).

**Risk level:** High — it runs without errors, which is precisely what makes the flaw invisible to anyone who only checks whether it executes.

**Setup (pre-generated artifact — option b):** This chapter's lesson is that fluent output looks like success, so validate this pre-generated artifact rather than something you wrote. An AI was asked to "clean this applicant dataset and justify your choices":

> ```python
> # Clean the applicant dataset: drop incomplete records, then summarize.
> import pandas as pd
> df = pd.read_csv("applicants.csv")
> df_clean = df.dropna()          # remove rows with any missing values
> rate = (df_clean["passed_screen"].mean())
> print(f"Cleaned {len(df_clean)} of {len(df)} rows.")
> print(f"Screen pass rate: {rate:.1%}")
> ```
> *Justification (model-written):* "I removed incomplete records to ensure data
> quality, then computed the screen pass rate on the clean data. The code runs
> without errors and handles nulls appropriately."

**The Validation Task:**

Evaluate the AI output above using the following checklist. For each item, record: Pass / Fail / Cannot determine — and explain your reasoning.

```
Validation Checklist — The Fluency Trap

□ Correctness: Does "runs without errors" mean the result is correct?
  What does dropna() across ALL columns do to applicants who left one optional
  field blank?
□ Completeness: What did the justification leave out?
  Does it report HOW MANY rows were dropped, or which kind of applicant they
  were?
□ Scope: Did the AI answer the actual question or a convenient version of it?
  The task said "justify your choices" — is dropping all incomplete rows a
  justified choice, or an unexamined default?
□ Silent bias (chapter-specific): If applicants who skipped an optional field
  are disproportionately the ones the screen was meant to surface, what does
  dropping them do to the pass rate?
□ Defensibility (chapter-specific): Could you explain and defend this cleaning
  choice in an interview, line by line, without the model?
□ Failure mode check: Does this output exhibit any of the following?
  - Fluent but wrong (a clean, confident result that is quietly biased)
  - Comprehension debt (output you would submit but could not reconstruct)
  - Missing ground truth (no check on whether the dropped rows mattered)
```

**What to do with your findings:**
- If the output passes all checks: use it. (It will not — `dropna()` across all columns is the trap.)
- If the output fails one check: rewrite the prompt to ask which rows are dropped and why, re-run, and re-validate.
- If the output fails multiple checks or you cannot determine pass/fail: this is a "When NOT to Use AI" moment — do the cleaning decision yourself and let the model only format the result.

**AI Use Disclosure prompt:**
After completing this validation, write a two-sentence AI Use Disclosure:
> *Sentence 1:* What AI produced in this exercise and how you used it.
> *Sentence 2:* One specific thing the AI could not determine that required your judgment.

**Series connection:** This exercise trains **Tier 4 metacognitive supervision** — catching fluent-but-wrong output by asking what the clean result concealed. It is the reflex the entire book is built to install: the difference between code that runs and code that is right.

## Prompts

### Figure 1.1 — The value split: who can supply the work
**Files:** ../images/01-the-fluency-trap-fig-01.svg · ../d3/01-the-fluency-trap-fig-01.html
**Prompt:** Two aligned stacked bars on white, the same value split recut by a second question. Render procedural competence as a tall neutral-gray base and judgment as a small cap in the one red accent; align the segment boundary across both bars with a dashed ink rule, zero baseline anchored.

### Figure 1.2 — The Anthropic RCT: comprehension by how the tool was used
**Files:** ../images/01-the-fluency-trap-fig-02.svg · ../d3/01-the-fluency-trap-fig-02.html
**Prompt:** Three vertical bars on white at zero baseline — hand-coding and AI-plus-interrogation near-level, AI-plus-delegation dropping off a cliff. Keep the high bars in neutral ink-gray and let the convergence read through a faint ochre reference line; reserve red for nothing but the chapter's brand mark.

### Figure 1.3 — AI as material risk: S&P 500 disclosures, 2023–2025
**Files:** ../images/01-the-fluency-trap-fig-03.svg · ../d3/01-the-fluency-trap-fig-03.html
**Prompt:** A single ascending line across three time points on a zero-anchored percent axis, nodes marked in ink. Draw the line in the one red accent and emphasize the steep first segment where hype becomes liability with a soft ochre slope band, gridlines as faint border hairlines only.

### Figure 1.4 — The 90-day OPT unemployment clock
**Files:** ../images/01-the-fluency-trap-fig-04.svg · ../d3/01-the-fluency-trap-fig-04.html
**Prompt:** One horizontal authorization bar on white with uniform day ticks, a dashed ink marker at the 80-day working limit and a solid red hard stop at 90 days. The 80-to-90 gap reads as a deliberate safety margin; no calendar or clock imagery, the bar and its two markers carry all the meaning.
